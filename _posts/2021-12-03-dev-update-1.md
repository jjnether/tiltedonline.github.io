title:  "Developer update #1 (3-12-2021)"
---

Hi folks,

These patch notes describe what we've accomplished this past month. We were able to do quite a lot in November. I can't promise that the patch notes will always be this big, since the current dev team only consists of 2 developers (including me), but we'll at least try to keep you up to date semi regularly. Whenever a new developer update goes up, I will post it in the `#dev-updates` channel on our Discord server.

Best,<br>
Robbe (cosideci).

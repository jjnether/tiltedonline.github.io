Hey everyone,

As many of you may know, Bethesda is releasing Skyrim Anniversary Edition soon. As the SKSE developers have already pointed out, this will break many mods (including ours), since they will be forcing this update on Skyrim Special Edition too. Not to worry, we do have solutions for every edition of our mod.

First, let's start with "old Skyrim Together", also sometimes referred to as "the Harbor edition" or "nightlies". This is the discontinued version of Skyrim Together. It has not been updated in over 2 years. It is still available to download, however, and many people are still playing it. We will not be updating this version of the mod to work with the anniversary update. Fortunately, there is a solution for those who want to keep playing this version of the mod - there is a [Nexus guide](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57618?tab=description) on how to revert your copy of Skyrim back to the current version.

Secondly, there's "Skyrim Together Reborn". This is the rewrite of the Skyrim Together mod, which has seen a lot of progress this year (more on that further down this announcement). We will be updating this version to work with the anniversary edition. This should have no impact on people playing Skyrim Together right now, since Reborn is not yet released.

Lastly, we wanted to give a little update on the progress we have made on Skyrim Together Reborn and Fallout 4 Together (collectively also known as Tilted Online). Since our last announcement, we have been working on syncing projectiles, which are now synced in both Skyrim and Fallout 4. Furthermore, magic spells and magic effects are synced too. Force has implemented a new launcher for Skyrim and Fallout 4. He is also working hard on our new UI for both the launcher and the in-game HUD.

In terms of gameplay features, we are fairly happy with what we have so far. In the coming months, we will be focusing on polishing existing features, improving stability, and trying to make the gameplay as solid as possible. One way we'll be doing that is by looking into how we can make questing as smooth as possible. We have already had some discussions about this with the community. If you have any suggestions in regards to this, or if you have any ideas on features that the mod should include, we have created a new Discord channel (`#development-feedback`) where you can talk to us and the community about it. Please do try to keep discussion in this channel on-topic.

As always, please remember that the mod will be ready when it's ready, and we can not give any estimations as to when we will release the mod, even though it might seem like the mod is practically finished (yes, we see you guys reacting with "soon" emojis in git-dev :p). You can view the list of completed features and planned features [here](https://wiki.tiltedphoques.com/tilted-online/features/tilted-online), though this list is subject to change.

Much love,
The Together Team.

P.S.: here's a little [sneak peak](https://gfycat.com/infamoustornfurseal) into projectile sync. It syncs pixel perfectly on all clients! :)

## Improvements

### Documentation

We are continually updating the documentation on the wiki to provide users with more precise installation steps and more tips for troubleshooting.

### UI

The UI's back end had a mini overhaul resulting in less issues with the UI not showing up, along with some new features. Now the UI also has more descriptive error messages.

### Features

* Player homes from DLC and mods should now also not sync chests.
* Linux support through Proton has been improved by allowing the UI to close.
* XP sync can now be disabled through a server setting.

## Bug Fixes

The bug reports submitted thus far have been helpful, and many more are being fixed. But it is important that future bug reports follow the template (link template) provided so they can be properly diagnosed.

* The server list is visible again.
* Some enemies not dying after going below 0 hp has been fixed by removing kill cams.
* Enemy aggro should now target the entire party more equally instead of just the party leader.
* The "Healing Hands" spell should now work on other players.
* Duplicated quest items can be dropped without them getting re-added.
* Fixed a crash when enchanting an item when the player was not connected to a server.
* Fixed the chest in "Diplomatic Immunity" being empty.
